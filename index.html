    <h1>Mieko Chun</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mieko! Originally from the Seattle area, I am now a third-year undergraduate at 
        UC San Diego pursuing a B.S. in Data Science with minors in Business Analytics and Cognitive Science. 
        I am a logical thinker, fascinated by how data informs decisions and allows innovation. 
        Currently, I am looking for a summer internship in the Greater Seattle Area or San Diego, with availability from June to September 2026. 
        I'm eager to apply my skills and contribute to a team where I can continue to learn and grow.</p>
